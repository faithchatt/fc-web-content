bio: >
  Steffen has been a Christian all his life, 27 years so far. He was baptized at 14 at a youth camp in Poland. He lives in Tennessee but is a citizen of both France and the United States. He is currently working as an independent contractor, and he has so far spent one year at the Full Time Training in London - a seminary of sorts - and he is planning on going back as soon as possible. He has served with youth often, even during his high school years, and continues to do so now. He loves God's Word, and the depths and riches that can be found therein. That's why He has started doing online Bible studies - so that what He has learned about the Bible can be passed on to others, as it not only should, but must be.
