bio: >
  Alfonso Izaquirre Martinez, known online as "Poncho", is a professing Christian since Dec. 7th, 2015. He's a regular preacher and a -not so good- keyboard player at his Church since last 2020, where he also serves as a Teacher and has been prepared to be ordained in the Youth Ministry in the following months. He's currently studying his Bible and Theology Diploma at The Master's Academy International. He's not that much into videogames, he likes reading and chess. Three years ago, he joined "Luz Admirable", a Spanish-speaking youth ministry in Mexico City where he started teaching and preaching more often. In mid 2020, he and his friends decided to found "Teolog√≠a para Todos" (Theology for Everyone), a youth christian coalition focused on teaching the Gospel of Christ, full display to all peoples from every generation and cultural background. Poncho lives in Mexico City, and his main hobby is to be the President of his own self-proclaimed micronation called The H.H.R.R. of Nisea.
